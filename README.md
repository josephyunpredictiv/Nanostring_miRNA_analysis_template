# Nanostring_miRNA_analysis_template
Nanostring data analysis with random forest. Comparing HFD vs CD vs C. Only analysis 13 is included.

Mainly suppsoed to be a safekeeping for myself but I figured some other people could use it too. Contains heatmap, countplots, and PCA as well as random forest. Of course also going through DESEQ2 process as well. 

Use n solver to convert nanostring RCC data into csv :)
